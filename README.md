Task #1:
Use "PMTViewer.ipynb" to load and visualize waveforms from source ROOT file
 
Task #2:
- Write functions to calculate waveform baseline and RMS
- Write function to identify single photo-electrons (SPEs) based on some threshold value (informed by the noise level, i.e. x3 noise RMS)
- Write a function to calculate the area and amplitude (both baseline subtracted) of the SPE.
- Plot a spectrum of the SPE areas and amplitudes for each channel.
